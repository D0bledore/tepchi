# UX Improvements

This update refines the Tepchi website based on five core principles.

## Consistency
- Introduced CSS variables for main colors to ensure uniform styling.
- Added an `active` state in navigation highlighted via JavaScript.

## Intuitiveness
- Navigation links now underline on hover/focus and indicate the current page.
- The contact form button includes hover and focus feedback.

## Accessibility
- Added a "skip to content" link and focus styles for keyboard navigation.
- Improved font sizing and line height for better readability.
- Navigation now uses `aria-label`.

## Responsiveness
- Navigation and service cards stack vertically on narrow screens via media query.
- Images already scale to fit their containers; no changes needed there.

## Minimalism
- Simplified layout by removing inline styles and consolidating color definitions.

These changes enhance usability across devices while keeping the interface clean and familiar.
