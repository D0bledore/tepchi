# Tepchi Example Website

This repository contains a small multi-page site inspired by the original Tepchi Skrädderi & Kemtvätt web page. The content is simplified but includes the key information:

- **`index.html`** – Starts with an image of the shop and a short list of tjänster (services).
- **`about.html`** – Presents the history of the business since 1976.
- **`contact.html`** – Provides address, phone number and opening hours.

All pages share a navigation bar and footer. Styling is provided in **`style.css`** and a minimal JavaScript file is included as **`script.js`**.

To view the site, open `index.html` in a web browser.
