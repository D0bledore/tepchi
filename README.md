## Navbar Redesign Notes

- **Dynamic Links** – Links to front-page sections are shown only on `index.html`. Pages using the shared `header.html` omit these anchors to avoid broken navigation.
- **Sticky Header** – The header is now `position: sticky` so navigation is always accessible while scrolling.
- **Compact Layout** – Navigation and logo are arranged with flexbox. The logo doubles as a home link.
- **Mobile Menu** – A hamburger toggle reveals the menu on small screens for better usability.

These changes modernize the site and optimize space usage across devices.
