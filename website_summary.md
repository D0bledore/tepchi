# Website Summary

## 1. Site structure
- The project includes three HTML pages: `index.html`, `about.html`, and `contact.html`.
- Each page contains a consistent header with navigation links between the pages, as shown in `index.html` lines 10‑18.
- Content sections include a hero image and service listings on the home page, history on the about page, and contact details on the contact page.
- A footer is present on every page to display copyright information.

## 2. CSS usage
- All styling is consolidated into `style.css` and applied across pages.
- Styles define basic layout and colors for the body, header, navigation, footer, and sections (see lines 1‑65 in `style.css`).
- Classes like `.hero`, `.services`, and `.history` use flexbox to arrange images and captions consistently.
- The CSS is relatively simple, with few redundant rules, though repeated HTML structures could benefit from more modular classes.

## 3. JavaScript functionality
- JavaScript is minimal. The single `script.js` file only logs a message to the console (`script.js` lines 1‑2).
- There are no event listeners or DOM manipulations, so interactive features are limited to built‑in HTML behaviors.

## 4. Embedded services
- The site links to an external Facebook profile via a standard anchor element (see `contact.html` lines 21‑31).
- No additional widgets or API integrations are present (e.g., no maps or review systems).

## 5. Overall recommendations
- Consider extracting the common header and footer into reusable templates or server‑side includes to reduce duplication.
- Expand JavaScript if interactive features are needed (form validation, dynamic content, etc.).
- Review image sizes and compression for faster loading, and provide descriptive alt text for accessibility.
- Consolidate styles for scalability if more pages or components are added in the future.
