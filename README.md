# Tepchi Example Website

This repository contains a small multi-page site inspired by the original Tepchi Skrädderi & Kemtvätt web page. The content is simplified but includes the key information:

- **`index.html`** – Starts with an image of the shop and a short list of tjänster (services).
- **`about.html`** – Presents the history of the business since 1976.
- **`contact.html`** – Provides address, phone number and opening hours.

Common header and footer markup are stored in **`header.html`** and **`footer.html`**. These are loaded on each page via **`script.js`** so that navigation and copyright
information stay consistent. Styling is provided in **`style.css`** and additional JavaScript handles smooth scrolling and basic contact form validation.

To view the site, open `index.html` in a web browser.
